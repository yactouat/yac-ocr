# yac-OCR

## What is this?

This is a repository that contains code for my OCR experiments. This project was created in order to complete the project at the end of the dreaded chapter 4 of [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) course.

Python requirements are specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
